> I hade the idea to use algorithm similar to code to compress the Effect text as much as possible while still having it making sens, i taught that creating a new logical symtax might be usfull.
> So far i tryed adding IF THEN, and maybe some FOR, syntax, the classic operrator like += and ++ and == might also make sense and give use a lot of option
> Some card benefit from having other type in the deck while others benefit from having a lot of the same type in the deck, i try to avoid card specific effect to have more combinason of card possible.

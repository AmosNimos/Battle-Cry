# Battle-Cry
> The name is not set in stone yet.

Battle-Cry is a free open source tcg card game inspired by mtg, pokemon and yu-gi-oh. all the rules and art are open source. for free fun and game.
I higly recommend you use open softwair for making art for this project, may i suggest gimp and inkscape.

## Goals
- Easy to Learn.
- Easy to Play.
- Minimal Reading required while playing.
- Playable on paper & on the terminal.
- Fair & free.
- Every card is compatible with every deck.
- No extra deck
- Only one type of card Creature with effect

### Ways of making it fair
- The lot of card is shuffled then splited in x amounth of player.
- Each player make a new deck from their portion of the card lot before each game.
 -Each player swap deck after each match.

> if mana should be used for the monster cost, i suggest their should be a single type of it.

### Card Design
# the basic template:
- Name of the card
- Requirement to play the card
- large image
- card type
- effect
- values

> The therminology is still open to change. send your suggestion in the github discussion.
#### Creature/Monster/Demon card
monster all have effect
flavore text is separate from the card and can be found online instead. (NO WASTED SPACE)

They have Attack point and Life point.
the attack is the damage they do
life is the amounth of total damage they can't take befor dying does not automatically regenerate after battle except if specified otherwise by a card


#### Game theme and concept
This is a serius looking game with dark artstyle. 
The card color it self is black.
the concept of the game is that each card is the page out of a Mage book
and every card is an arcane invocation.

##### type of invocation:
Nether (Invoque dead Spirit, gosth and spectre)
Hell (invoke demon)
Crypt (Invoque dead creature)
Void (Invoque life form from deep space) 
Golem (Humonculus and created life form, made from material combinason)

> maybe: parallel (Invoque from another dimention)

##### card value:
> These value will be change!
casual 0 to 20
Fuse 20 to 40 (When amouth of duplicate equal to a Fuse cost are on the field you can discard them and play their fuse summon from  your deck or your hand)
evo 30 to 60 (Discard a monster of the same type to play a evo with a cost == to the evo cost-1, mana still need to be payed.)
between 0 to 60 FIX (never a card shall exist that have defaault value higher then these value) to avoid power creep.

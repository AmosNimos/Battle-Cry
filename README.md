# Bettle-Cry

Battle-Cry is a free open source tcg card game inspired by mtg, pokemon and yu-gi-oh. all the rules and art are open source. for free fun and game.
I higly recommend you use open softwair for making art for this project, may i suggest gimp and inkscape.

## Goals
- Easy to Learn.
- Easy to Play.
- Minimal Reading required while playing.
- Playable on paper & on the terminal.
- Fair & free.
- Every card is compatible with every deck.
- No extra deck

### Ways of making it fair
- The lot of card is shuffled then splited in x amounth of player.
- Each player make a new deck from their portion of the card lot before each game.
 -Each player swap deck after each match.

### Card Design
# the basic template:
- Name of the card
- Requirement to play the card
- large image
- card type
- effect
- values

#### Game theme and concept
This is a serius looking game with dark artstyle. 
The card color it self is black.
the concept of the game is that each card is the page out of a Mage book
and every card is an arcane invocation.

##### type of invocation:

Neither (Invoque dead Spirit, gosth and spectre)
Hell (invoke demon)
Crypt (Invoque dead creature)
parallel (Invoque from another dimention)
void (Invoque life form from deep space) 
Golem (Humonculus and created life form, made from material combinason)


##### card value:
between 0 to 60 FIX (never a card shall exist that have defaault value higher then these value) to avoid power creep.

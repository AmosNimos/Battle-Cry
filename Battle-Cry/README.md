## Project state:
🔧 🚧🚧🚧 Incomplete, In development 🚧🚧🚧 👷

(Keep in mind that at the moment, This project is currently undone, and will not work, if you try to lunch it.)

I will probably Reuse some code and thechnics from this previus project of mine.
It was a verry similar project, and i learn a lot from making it, even do I try to keep this project simple, i do not whish to rush it, and i do not have that much free time to work on it, so things can take some time to take shape.

# What is tcg-term?
It started as a project to make an mtg alternative game on the linux terminal, but i now aim to include other style of tcg game play mode while avoiding to enfringe on the copy rightable content. 

It is a minimalistic, open-source, tcg-like game, made in python, that can be played on most terminal emulator on linux.
The first goal to be realistic in scope, is to have a playable single player game, with simple generated card, that have simple [__Keyword ability__](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Keyword_ability) effect. Then once completed, add complexity progressivelly, and maybe in the far long distant future a form of multiplayer.

3 main gamemode "inspired" by:
- magic
- pokemon
- yu-gi-oh

> And maybe a gamemode called __Battle-Cry__ ( Another one of my open source project Here on Github. )
